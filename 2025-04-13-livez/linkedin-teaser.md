üîí **Securing Kubernetes API Server Health Checks: Can You Disable Anonymous Access Without Breaking Things?**

By default, Kubernetes allows anonymous access to health check endpoints like `/livez` and `/readyz`. While convenient, this can pose a security risk. But what if you want to disable anonymous access globally for better security, yet still allow these crucial checks?

It turns out there's a way using `AuthenticationConfiguration` introduced via KEP-4633! This allows fine-grained control over which paths permit anonymous requests, even when `--anonymous-auth=false`.

Want to learn how to implement this for a more secure cluster?
